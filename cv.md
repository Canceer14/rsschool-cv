>Hello everyone, I'm Sasha from Belarus, Grodno, I'm 24. I have finished school ,then I have already graduated from college After college I went to Lithuania to work here like a builder Some time later I decided,that I donâ€™t want to degrade being there for it.I changed my mind .Now I want to try myself in IT. At the moment I am working as a programmer in a hospital, despite the fact that I like my current job responsibilities, I feel that I am ready for more responsible tasks. Due to financial problems, I am concerned about the instability of my work, so I decided to start looking for new options. I can describe myself as a sociable, executive and hardworking person. I can say with confidence that I am ready for responsibility and difficult personal and professional tasks. In principle, I believe that our whole life is given for self-development and self-improvement. That is why I always strive to learn a lot of new things and often do self-education. I like to read both fiction and scientific literature, which can help me in my work. Learning is easy for me, I quickly remember, especially if the information is interesting to me I will start from 0 by the spring of 2024 and will be a DEVELOPER. My motivation is money in this area, then tell the world.
